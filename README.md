# The power of Data Science!

This, of course, is an oft-quoted Spider-man line. I don't think any individual need bear the responsibility of a superhero, but it is important to understand the value of technical analysis skills in the context of modern social issues. Within the workplace, data science skills can greatly increase your utility as an employee or prospective applicant. What is not always mentioned is that these same skills can be applied to positively impact your community. The concept of open science has led to new standards in open data, and there is an exciting plethora of raw information ready to be probed for insights. Organizations focused on data science for social good are rapidly growing, and the volunteer soup kitchen seems to have a 21st-century rendition.

Many local and federal governments support access to interesting datasets; as this trend grows, the utility of open information becomes more robust. Data is begging for audacious volunteers to poke and prod it, and make use of the raw input in an impactful way. We can now fight crime as a vigilante - all from behind a computer.

In this notebook, we will explore San Francisco crime data in order to understand the relationship between civilian-reported incidents of crime and police-reported incidents of crime. Along the way we will use table intersection methods to subset our data, aggregation methods to calculate important statistics, and simple visualizations to understand crime trends.
